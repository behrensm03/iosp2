This is the first project from my Intro to iOS Development class. The task was to create a simple app that allows you to add items and quantity to a grocery list. The app was required to have the same design as a screenshot provided to us. Then, I implemented the "challenge problems", or features of the app that are just for fun and not required.

These  include the data validation feedback, which does not let the user add an item to the list if either the item name field or the quantity field is empty. It also prevents a user from adding an item to the list if it is already in the list.

The second challenge problem was to implement a toggle switch so that the user can only edit the list when the switch is activated.

The third challenge was to display the list in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order depending on a UISegmentedControl. When Alphabetical mode is active, the contents of the list are shuffled around to alphabetical order and any items added to the list will be inserted into the proper place to maintain alphabetical order. Reverse alphabetical order functions similarly.

The fourth and final challenge was to add the remove button. The user inputs the item name into the field and upon clicking remove, the item and its quantity are removed from the list. If the item is not in the list, feedback is shown.
